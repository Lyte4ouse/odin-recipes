        <h1>Directions</h1>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees. 
            Cook rice according to package instructions.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, trim about 1/4-inch from tops of bell peppers 
            and then remove stems, ribs and seeds. 
            Fill a baking dish just large enough to fit peppers 
            with about 1/2-inch of water.</li>
            <li>Place peppers upside down in water, 
            cover tightly with foil and bake 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile heat olive oil in a lage non-stick skillet
            over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add onion and saute 3 minutes.
            Move onions to far side of the skillet.</li>
            <li>Add beef in chunks, season with salt and pepper
            then let sear until browned on bottom, 2-3 minutes</li>        
            <li>Break up beef and toss with onions and continue to cook 2 minutes,
            add garlic and cook until beef is cooked 
            through about 1 minute longer.</li>    
            <li>Remove from heat, 
            drain off excess fat (I like to tilt skillet to one side 
            and dab up excess fat using tongs and paper towels).</li>    
            <li>Stir in tomatoes, half of the tomato sauce (about 1/2 cup), 
            cooked rice, parsley, Italian seasoning and season with salt 
            and pepper to taste.</li> 
        </ol>      
        <p><strong>How Long To Cook Stuffed Peppers</strong></p>  
        <ol>
            <li>Reduce oven temperature to 350. 
                Turn par-baked peppers upright and fill with beef filling.</li>
            <li>Pour remaining tomato sauce over peppers. 
                Cover with foil and continue to bake 20 minutes.</li>    
            <li>Remove from oven, sprinkle with cheese, 
                return to oven and bake until peppers have reached desired tenderness, 
                about 10 â€“ 20 minutes (thinner peppers will be 
                done near lesser time thicker near greater). 
                Sprinkle with parsley and serve warm.</li>    
        </ol>
